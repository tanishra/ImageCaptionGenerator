# ImageCaptionGenerator

An image caption generator is a powerful application that combines Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to automatically generate relevant captions for images. It allows machines to recognize the context of an image and annotate it with descriptive text. In your project, you’ve used two fundamental techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

# CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
CNN is a specialized deep neural network architecture primarily used for image recognition and classification.
It processes 2D matrix-like image data and can handle scaled, translated, and rotated imagery.
CNN scans images from left to right and top to bottom, extracting relevant features.
These features are then combined to classify the image.

# LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels at sequence prediction tasks.
It’s commonly used for next-word prediction (similar to how Google Search suggests the next word based on context).
LSTM retains relevant information while discarding non-relevant details during input processing.
To build an image caption generator, you merge CNN with LSTM:
Image Caption Generator Model (CNN-RNN model) = CNN + LSTM
CNN: Extracts features from the image.
LSTM: Generates a description based on the extracted image information.

# Dataset
For training your image caption generator, you’ve used the Flickr_8K dataset.
This dataset contains images along with descriptive captions.
The combination of CNN and LSTM learns to associate image features with relevant text descriptions.
The model is trained to predict captions for unseen images based on the learned patterns in the dataset.
